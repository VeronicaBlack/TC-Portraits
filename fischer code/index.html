	<p> John H. Fischer, TC's sixth president and also a former dean of the College, passed away in late December at the age of 99. Fischer served as TC's president from 1962 through 1974. A former elementary school teacher, guidance counselor and vice principal, he came to national attention through his enforcement of desegregation as the superintendent of Baltimore city schools, a post he had assumed in 1953.
	<p>
	During his brief tenure in that role, he changed the entrance level grade to the college from a B minus to at least a B average, granting few exceptions to students who did not meet the criteria. He also changed the academic standards in courses and papers, and stiffened the final oral examination on doctoral projects. All of these changes helped position Teachers College as a leader in the educational field.
	<p>
	One of Fischer's goals when he assumed the presidency at TC in 1962 was to give greater attention to problems in the urban education sector -- specifically to inner-city schools in New York. During his tenure, TC established the Institute for Urban and Minority Education (IUME), as well as the Institute of International Studies. Fischer also served as member and chair of the National Commission on the Education of the Disadvantaged and the National Advisory Commission on Education of Disadvantaged Children from 1965 to 1969.
	<p>
	Fischer also was a major supporter of TC’s work in building an education system in Afghanistan, making one and sometimes two trips to Kabul himself each year.

<!-- CV/Resume -->
		<p>In a December 1965 address to the Governor’s Conference on Education in Salt Lake City, Utah, Fischer also spoke out in defense of individual creative and imagination.
		<p>
		“In a world increasingly preoccupied with the problems of organization, of collectivism, of mass responses to mass media, it becomes more important than ever that education serve as countervailing influence on the side of individuality,” he said. “To look upon imagination only as one of the more charming qualities of childhood would be to denigrate the clear evidence that it is essential to all creative or critical ability.”
		<p>
		Fischer taught at many universities during his long career, including Harvard, Johns Hopkins (where he was also a trustee of the College), Duke, the University of Chicago, Emory and the University of Maryland. He served as a consultant to what was then the U.S. Office of Education, as well as to the Department of State and the Carnegie, Ford and Kellogg Foundations, among many others. He earned his undergraduate degree at Johns Hopkins University and his doctorate from Teachers College.
