	<p> Dr. Edward Lee Thorndike made his greatest contribution in scientific research, which influenced the method and practice in elementary and secondary education. </p>

	<p> The celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of Professor E. L. Thorndike's connection with Teachers College was marked by the dinner given for his family, students, and friends, at the Faculty Club in February, 1926, and by the special issue of the TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD for February of that year, containing a bibliography of his works. The last permanent item in this occasion of recognition is the hanging in Teachers College of his portrait, which was unveiled on February 16, 1928.
	<p>
	The portrait is the work of the distinguished painter, Wayman Adams. It shows Dr. Thorndike in academic dress in a sitting position. The use of color in the background gives life and verve to the picture. No painter could hope to convey to the full the dynamic personality that Teachers College has known for these twenty-five years, but Mr. Adams has brought unusual understanding to his task, and has achieved an artistic success as well as a satisfying likeness. The portrait is hung in the lobby of the second floor of Russell Hall, near the psychology division of the library.
	<p>
	The unveiling took place in the presence of a group of friends and faculty of Teachers College. The presentation was made by Dr. John J. Coss of Columbia University on behalf of the friends and students who had planned for the portrait to be painted. Dean William F. Russell accepted the gift in the name of Teachers College in a speech of affectionate recognition of the influence of Dr. Thorndike in the life of the College and of his position among educators and psychologists.  </p>

	<h1 id="item03">Father of modern educational psychology</h1>

<p>
	Edward Lee Thorndike was a psychologist who spent nearly his entire career at Teachers College, Columbia University. His work on Comparative psychology and the learning process led to the theory of connectionism and helped lay the scientific foundation for modern educational psychology. He also worked on solving industrial problems, such as employee exams and testing.</p>
